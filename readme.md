Quake 3 DirectX Raytracing Project!

If you want something more stable, go to my Quake 1 DirectX Raytracing Project. 
https://github.com/jmarshall23/QuakeRTX

This repository contains the Quake 3 Arena demo files, and will only run with q3dm7.

I'm planning on making a game using idTech, and I wanted some options(either the Quake 1 engine or the Quake 3 engine),
as a result, only q3dm7 is basically playable. The lighting rigs in Quake 3 aren't great and would need to be modified
to get the best looking and performing results.

The UI also isn't working yet. Build the game, and use the command line in the run.bat.
